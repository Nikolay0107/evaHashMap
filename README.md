# evaHashMap
Hashmap realization


Task:
Develop an own version of map, wich represents a map with keys of type Long.
Let it be a hash table like, for example, HashMap. You shouldn't use any existing implementations of maps,
and your implementation should perfom as best as you can make it (using less memory, for example).
You must provide tests to make a ground for your solution for further interview questions.
